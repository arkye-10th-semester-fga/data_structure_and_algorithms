38
Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago,
never mind how long precisely,
having little or no money in my purse,
and nothing particular to interest me on shore,
I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago, never [38]
mind how long precisely, having little [38]
or no money in my purse, and nothing [36] -> 4
particular to interest me on shore, I [37] -> 1
thought I would sail about a little [35] -> 9
and see the watery part of the world. [38] -> 1

Slack: 4 + 1 + 9 + 1 = 15
