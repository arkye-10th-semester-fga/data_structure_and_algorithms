64
Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago,
never mind how long precisely,
having little or no money in my purse,
and nothing particular to interest me on shore,
I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago, never mind how long [52] -> 144
precisely, having little or no money in my purse, and nothing [61] -> 9
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would [53] -> 121
sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. [57] -> 49

Slack: 144 + 9 + 121 + 49 = 323
